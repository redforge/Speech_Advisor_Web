# Speech-Advisor-Web
### Speech Advisor is a (currently in development) tool to give real time feedback on scripted dictation to help users improve their public speaking abilities
[Speech Advisor (deprecated) ](https://github.com/Mason739/Public_Speaking) was my team's project for MetroHacks III, and recieved the grand prize.  
When developing it further, I realized that python wasn't very well suited for what we were trying with the frontend, and that the requirement for API keys unnecessarily lowered accessiblity.  
  
<b> Speech Advisor Web </b>is a total rewrite of the original Speech Advisor to run fully in browser using javascript's newly introduced speech recognition standard.
